I will continuously update and improve it.\nComments or suggestions on how to improve it are welcome :-)\nTo begin with, you will need the following to set up your blog\n\nInstall Blogdown.\nSelect a Hugo theme.\nSet up blogdown\nCreate a Github repository for your website.\nSet up Netlify for continuous deployment\nContinue editing your blog and enjoy writing!!\n\nScroll down to unlock the bonus tip/idea :-)\n1. Installing Blogdown\nInstall blogdown in R studio from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"blogdown\")\nOr, install from GitHub\nif (!requireNamespace(\"devtools\")) install.packages(\"devtools\") devtools::install_github(\"rstudio/blogdown\")\nMore\nhere : blogdown installation\n2. Selecting a Hugo Theme\nHugo is a lightweight engine that can be used to create static\nwebsites. Hugo uses Go library for its template engine. You\nwill be required to select a theme, here is the complete list. More on setting up\nHugo themes here.\n3. Set up Blogdown\nAfter selecting the Hugo theme, using R studio open a new project and\ndirectory: using File → New Project → New Directory → Website using\nBlogdown\n\nYou will be required to specify the directory name of the blog, the\nsubdirectory where the blog is going to be place and the theme you\nselected in step 2 above. Complete the set up by clicking create\nproject. More on blogdown Rstudio IDE here.\nYou can modify the config.toml file, create new posts…\nThe website created can be built interactively by using\nblogdown::serve_site() or clicking Addins as shown\n\nNow you can create a New Post by clicking New Post using\nthe Addins or new_post(title = 'xxx.md') for markdown post\nor new_post(title = 'xxxx.Rmd') for R markdown files.\nBlogdown Structure\nDepending on the theme selected, kindly note\n\nStatic folder : is the root folder for the new blog.\nThis is a perfect place to include the images folder or pdf/materials\nfolder.\nPublic folder : after building the website - the final\nrendered static HTML files and structure are stored here. This is the\nfolder that shall be uploaded to Github.\nTheme folder : all the formating for the Hugo theme you\nselected are stored here.\nContent folder : is the folder containing all the posts\nyou will create. Usually has some markdown or .Rmd from the example\nsite.\n\n4. Deployment with Github\nLog into Github and create a new repository - do not add a readme.md\nyet. I prefer this way so that I do not have to make a\ngit pull request.\n\nPush the existing website located in your local directory to the\nrepository using the command line as shown below - note to change the\nworking directory to public/ before initializing the GIT repository\ncd ../public. I noticed if the whole working directory is\nput on Github - you will be required to add a netlify.toml\nfile - not sure if it was the theme I was using back then or it is\nuniversal. Best practise is to upload public folder since\nit contains the rendered HTML files of your website.\nAfter changing to ../public folder where the HTML files\nare rendered do;\ngit init : to initialize the local\ndirectory/repository\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/username/repositoryname.git\n_for example https://github.com/innocenter/Another-Data-Enthusist.git_\ngit push -u origin master\nNow you can add a readme.md note. You will be required to pull(fetch\nand merge) the files if you add any file using Github online. Safe to\nupdate in local directory using git add readme then\ngit commit -m \"read me\".\n\nAlthough Github supports only Jekyly and not Hugo, you can publish\nstatic HTML pages. Reference the following link\n\n5. Continous deployment with\nNetlify\nNow worry not about having to upload the public folder to Netlify everytime. Connect the Github\nrepository and let Netlify continously deploy your website anytime you\nupdate.\nAnother route will be to skip Github but everytime you will have to\nupload the public folder to Netlify.\nLog in to Netlify create a new site using Github\n\nSelect Github and follow the steps to deploy the website - netlify\nwill turn to green if the deployment was a success.\n\nYou can edit the setting of your website name\n\nNow you are ready to role - update Github by adding any new files and\ncommitting the changes. Now you have a domain name\nwebsite.netlify.com- remember to edit the config.toml\nbaseurl which was set with a trailing backslash\nbaseurl = \"/\". Copy the name of the website and replace it\nas baseurl = \"https://name-of-website.netlify.com\" This is\nwhy\n\nThe only purpose for the baseurl field in the config is to define the\nfull base URL of your website for deployment purposes.” - @rdwatters\n\nAnd the bonus is!!!!\nAdding comment section\nusing Disquis\nYou can include comments in your new webiste. Yay!! Follow the\nfollowing reference How\nto install disqus on hugo that provides clear way to setup.\nWorking on a post\nand prefer to upload later?\nNo problem, if it is a markdown file, you can either\nCreate the content with a future or past publishDate\nvalue for example date : “2019-08-01” and publishDate:\n‘2020-03-04’\nCreate content with draft: true status\nOther useful\nresources for setting up a blog\nCreating a website can be messy. You will actually get a lot of\nerrors - The following resources might be useful. The helped me a\nlot.\nCreating\nthe blog\nBlogdown book\nby Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill\nBlogdown and\nHugo\nChange the baseurl after getting a domain name. More\nhere\nLong live Netlifly! here\nHappy blogging :-)\nFeel free to drop a comment or suggestion in the comment section.\n\n\n\n",
