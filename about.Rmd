I am interested and curious about all things DATA! From designing surveys, collecting, pre-processing, analysing data and visualization. 

Currently, I study at the University of Auckland. My day-to-day PhD research involve developing statistical models for dimension reduction and developing Bayesian networks  to understand the interconnections with complex ecological ecosystems. I enjoy working in a collaborative and socially diverse environment.
