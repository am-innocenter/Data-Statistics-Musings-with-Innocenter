I am studying a PhD in Statistics at The University of Auckland. My aim is to develop statistical models for dimensionality reduction and apply Bayesian networks  to determine the interconnections of components within a complex ecological ecosystem.

I am interested and curious about all things DATA. This includes anything from designing surveys, collecting, mining, cleansing, analysing and visualisation to obtain data-driven insights from the  data. I enjoy data wrangling data, building tools and automating processes. This means I do data analytics/machine learning consultation (besides my PhD) and enjoy working in collaborative and socially diverse environments.
