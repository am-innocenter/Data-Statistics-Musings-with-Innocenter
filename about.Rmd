I am studying a PhD in Statistics at The University of Auckland. My aim(s) is to develop statistical models for dimensionality reduction and apply Bayesian networks  to determine the interconnections of components within a complex ecological ecosystem.

I am interested and curious about all things DATA! This includes anything from designing surveys, collecting, mining, cleansing, analysing and visualization to obtain insights about the data. This means I also do data analytics consultation gigs (besides my PhD) and enjoy working in a collaborative and socially diverse environment.
